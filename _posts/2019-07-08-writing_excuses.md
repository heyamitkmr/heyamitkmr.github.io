excerpt: "What reasons do I give myself for not writing intentionally."

Writing `500 words daily` is easier to commit to than to actually get done.

I managed an okay post of ~2500 words over 6 days but since then, there has been a gap.
Some of the "reasons" behind this gap (as well as earlier excuses for not writing):

1. _**I do not have a specific topic on which I want to write**_
  * Created a list of topics which I could readily pick up from 
  * Ended up not consulting the topic list or lost interest in most of them
  
2. _**I will write later in the day when I have more "mental space" to get to it**_
   * "Later in the day" almost always means "not today"
   * Writing down 500 words should not take more than ~30-45 mins
   * If you have not had 45 mins to spare at the scheduled time for almost a week, may be it's time to reschedule the writing slot. But stick to the schedule if you want to get it done.

3. _**I will write later once I have thought more about the topic**_
   * Improvement can keep one happening to an original piece once created.
   * Get something started and out there. First 500 words would be a blurb anyway.
   * The next 1500 words will come out gushing
   * Trimming the total 200 words back to ~1000 words would also need some time.

4. _**There are other things more important than writing that I should be doing right now.**_
   * Similar to excuse #2. If it's the immediate lack of time, rethink your schedule.
   * Otherwise it's okay to accept that writing is not a priority right now and move on.<br>
     No need to keep beating yourself up for not following up on a half-hearted commitment. 

These `~300 words` took me `~20 minutes`. And I consider it to be a successful attempt to write for the day.
