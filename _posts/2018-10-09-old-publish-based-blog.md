It has aged poorly, as now the current version of the blog is using Jekyll. But the previous one was not - and kinda, proudly so. Here's how it looked:

What is this
------------

-   A place to share some of my thoughts, opinions, ideas

Why did I need to do this
-------------------------

-   Because I could :)
-   Because I feel too strongly about some of the ideas / opinions to
    keep to myself
-   Because I hope this way I can better organize all the stuff I am
    working on

How was this built
------------------

This is a static site hosted for free on GitHub. The html is generated
using a [shell script I cobbled
together](https://github.com/proxygeek/publish/)

Essentially a lightly modified version of
[Expose](https://github.com/Jack000/Expose) - a wonderful bash script by
[Jack Qiao](http://jack.works/) Theme is based off
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)

Why didn't you just use Jekyll / Hugo / something similar
----------------------------------------------------------

-   Because I love the elegance and simplicity of one bash script
    handling everything I need to publish.
    -   No dependency on Ruby / Python / Go or anything other than
        couple of css files and an html template
    -   Despite having a little bit of exposure of working with Jekyll,
        the liquid filters still seemed a little magical to me. I
        understand the workings of bash better :)
-   Also, I could customize the bash-script to more closely suit my
    work-flow

Current issues
--------------

-   Broken links, here and there
-   Haywire formatting
-   Unedited posts; hopefully no spelling errors though
-   `And many, many more`
