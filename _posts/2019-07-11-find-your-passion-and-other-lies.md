excerpt: "Just 'finding your passion' is a myth; passions and interests are not fixed, motivation is finite, failure does not mean lack of skill, and having a clear plan is crucial - self-discovery requires patience, perseverance, and a growth mindset."

We often hear the advice to "find your passion" and follow it. But is
it really that simple? Is passion a fixed trait that we are born with,
or is it something that can be developed over time? And what happens
when we encounter obstacles and setbacks on the path to pursuing our
passions?

### Passions and Interests are not fixed and not limited

*Fixed theory vs. Developing theory* It's important to understand that
passions and interests are not fixed. The idea that we have one true
calling or purpose in life is a myth. Our interests and passions can
change and evolve over time, and that's okay. In fact, having a growth
mindset and being open to new experiences can lead us to discover new
passions that we never knew we had.

### Passion does not always equal motivation

*Motivation is a finite resource* Following your true passion does not
mean that there will always be an endless supply of motivation on the
road to your goal(s). Motivation is indeed a finite resource. Be sure
you start with a large reserve. The reality is that pursuing any goal
requires hard work, perseverance, and sometimes even sacrifice. It\'s
important to have realistic expectations and to be prepared to face
challenges along the way.

-   ***Corollary**: Lack of motivation at some stage should not be
    grounds for deciding that you are on the wrong path. And I am not
    talking about continued disinterest.*

### Failure does not always equal lack of skill

Failure does not mean that we are not cut out for something. It simply
means that we were not ready at that particular moment to achieve our
goals.

It might be a bad day; Much better competition; poor fit or something
entirely different.

We can learn from our failures and use them as opportunities to grow and
improve. And sometimes, it's just a matter of timing and being patient
until the right opportunity comes along.

### Documented Difference

Finally, it\'s important to have a clear plan and strategy for achieving
our goals. Even more important, we should be able to articulate what
changes are you making in your strategy. It could be as simple as "more
of X". But without any changes at all, it's just depending on blind
luck; not a recipe for success.


> * _Finding your passion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's a journey of self-discovery that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to learn and grow. By having a growth mindset and being open to new experiences, we can discover new passions and achieve our goals, even in the face of obstacles and setbacks._
