excerpt: "The catastrophe you're building in your head? Probably not real."
---

I've been feeling off since yesterday - head cluttered, consuming junk instead of creating anything useful. And this is a familiar pattern for me, may be you can relate too.  When your brain gets crowded, so you just .. check out. Mindless scrolling, too much reading, whatever keeps you from dealing with the actual things that need to be done. And that spiralling into not feeling good and the brain starting to get into "catastrophe-mode".

Times like this, I remember something I started telling myself a couple years back: "No drama."

Back then, I was on this ridiculous emotional rollercoaster. Some days I'd feel invincible - looking at a long to-do list with actual glee, getting things done one after another. Other days? The tiniest deviation from my plans would send me spiraling. I'd wake up 30 minutes late and would be bummed out. If I had not started on the morning routine by 08:30, I'd start feel like the entire day was shot already. I'd take an actual slow day and suddenly my inner critic is making a laundry list of my character flaws.

And on such days, even three small tasks on my to-do list would intimidate me.

That's when "No drama" became my go-to reminder. I'd repeat it to that inner voice working itself up in a downward spiral. Things are hardly ever as catastrophic as that voice makes them out to be.

When I'm in one of those phases, I'm way too much in my own head. Focused on the most trivial stuff. "Why is there so much dust on the cupboards?" "Why does the doorbell have to ring NOW?" Everything feels like evidence of a day gone wrong.

The "No drama" reminder helps me snap out of it and zoom out to the bigger picture. From "Am I working on the most important stuff today?" to  "What were my goals for this year again?". Or even "Am I generally happy these days - why or why not?"


That shift in perspective usually does the trick and helps me reset. But sometimes I need extra help getting unstuck: writing it all out, taking a 30-60 minute walk somewhere I haven't been recently, a change of environment, or yeah - some coffee.

But it all starts with that reminder: "No drama." The catastrophe you're building in your head? Probably not real.
