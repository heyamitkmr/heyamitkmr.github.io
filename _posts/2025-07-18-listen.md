excerpt: "Start noticing that quiet voice in your head - and be willing to follow where it leads."
---

We always hear that tiny voice within us, sometimes warning us, sometimes just declaring what it wants, and sometimes yearning for something, it really cannot find the right words for.

Often we squash that little voice, things to take care of here and now. "Too impractical your demands are" - we say to it. "Good, fanciful dreaming" - we say, and get back to where we were.

But sometimes we listen. And decide to pay attention. We listen to see what it really wants. Behind the words it is saying to us.  Even help it formulate those right words when it is unable to find the right ones.

And then we decided to do something about it. No longer going back to where we were, doing what we were doing. But instead, moving ever so slightly.

And in those moments of listening deeply, even to that tiny voice inside us. We learn something new. And choose to change.

But perhaps the most important thing is to just start noticing that quiet voice - and to be willing to follow where it leads.
