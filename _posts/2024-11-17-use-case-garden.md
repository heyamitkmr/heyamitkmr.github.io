We just launched **[v0.1 of Use Case Garden](https://coda.io/d/Use-Case-Garden-v0-1_doqFblpa9DQ/Use-Case-Garden-v0-1_suUYWxZA#_luDxa8um)** - a community-driven space to bridge the gap between what AI can do and what needs to be done.

Today's AI is incredibly capable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand text, images, voice – pretty much anything we throw at them. But there's a massive gap between these capabilities and real-world impact. Espeically those at population scale in country like India. Many brilliant solutions are just waiting for the right problems. Or the "killer app" - like they say.

From the release of [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet) in 2008, it took 13 years to reach [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E). 4 years from introduction of [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) till we got ChatGPT. We have all these powerful tools from the AI revolution. Now it's time to put them to work.


### **What is Use Case Garden**
Use Case Garden aims to bridge this gap. We're starting with an initial set of concrete use-cases across healthcare, logistics, and energy and more. Each use case explores:
- Real opportunities for AI to make a difference,
- Practical constraints and context that shape successful solutions, and
- The key collaborators – domain experts, practitioners, and innovators – who can make these solutions possible


### **How it works**
We are thinking of it as a garden of possibilities, tended by a community of makers and domain experts. We're taking a dual-track approach:

1. [A searchable repository of use cases](https://pplus.ai/usecasegarden), each mapping specific AI capabilities to real-world needs
2. [Monthly maker meetups](https://lu.ma/6rdyljxx) where practitioners can connect, share insights, and find collaboration opportunities


We're launching with:
- Simple problem-solution mapping
- Cross-domain connections
- Open contribution model (MIT licensed)


### **Get Involved**
If you're building AI solutions, facing domain challenges, or want to help shape the future of AI applications, join us.

This is just v0.1. But we believe making the bridge from capability to impact needs to be a community effort.

- Check out [the repository](https://pplus.ai/usecasegarden)
- Join our next maker meetup in December 2024
- [Share a use case](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Your%20use%20case%20here%20%23AwesomeProject) using Twitter
    - Yes, you can also share your idea directly through Twitter by just using the hashtag [#UseCaseGarden](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23UseCaseGarden)


Together, let's move from "what AI can do" to "what needs to be done."
