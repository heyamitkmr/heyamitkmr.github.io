excerpt: "Fast decisions lead to more action, and action has its own magic."
---

I read something recently that stuck with me: a company is just a group of people making decisions. It's the decisions part that resonated. I'm a slow decision-maker, but not indecisive. I'm clear on some things, but most of the time, I overthink.

My structured approach to decision-making serves me well in certain situations, but most decisions aren't life-or-death. They're not even permanent. They may not even be needed to be explained to others. So, why do I give them so much weight? I think it's because I'm afraid of being wrong, of closing off other options.

But the truth is, most decisions don't require hours of deliberation. Most of the times it's little more than a coin-flip. At max, they require a willingness to take a leap, to trust our instincts. When faced with a decision holding you for more than 5 mins, ask yourself: is this worth spending an extra hour, day, or week on? Probably not. Take a deep breath, make a call, and move on.

Fast decisions lead to more action, and action has its own magic.*

But we're often held back by fear. Fear of making the wrong choice, fear of being challenged, fear of appearing fickle. So we spend time analysing, shoring up arguments to defend our positions and being stubborn (that's different from [being persistent](https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html)). What if we just let go of that fear?

I think it's okay to be wrong. In fact, it's more than okay - it's necessary. Not standing up for anything is far more boring and unproductive than standing up for the wrong thing. So, let people call you out, challenge your decision, and hear them out. You might just learn something.

And yes, it's okay to change your mind. It's okay to be flexible, to adapt to new information. That's not being fickle, that's being human. The key is to find a balance between being open to new ideas and standing by your core principles.

So, the next time you catch yourself sitting on a decision, remember: it's not about being right, it's about finding out. Just take a breath, trust your instincts, and take the step (it's likely not the leap you think it is).
