***Ideally, it should be outliner meets editor meets to-do-list***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outliner:
---------

-   `Simple entity structure` like WorkFlowy where everything is a node;
    not a notebook vs note vs to-do distinction; See Outliner (the app)
    or may be Orgzly
-   Support for `infinite listing`
-   `Seamless sync across devices` - untested
-   `Powerful search` features with tag support
-   `Collapsing and expanding` any node
-   `Focus on any one node at a time` - like WorkFlowy

Editor:
-------

-   `Support for attachments`
-   `Support for longform text`
-   `Markdown`
-   Auto `time-stamping`

To-Do List:
-----------

-   `Due dates`
-   `Reminders`
-   `Prioritization`

Misc.:
------

-   `Open source and free` - as in freedom
-   `Affordable`
-   `No forced-cloud-hosting`; option to use 3rd party providers like
    GoogleDrive / DropBox or own cloud
-   `Hand-writing support` like in FiiNotes - best so far
