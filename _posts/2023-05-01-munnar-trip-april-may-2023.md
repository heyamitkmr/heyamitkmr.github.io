Last weekend, we embarked on a refreshing weekend trip to Munnar from
April 28 to April 30, 2023. We too a bus from Bangalore (Greenline),
which dropped us off at Theni. From there, a smaller bus took me to
Munnar, which was about 70 km away. Just a heads up - be prepared for
this little bus-relay!

#### Plan

Upon reaching Munnar, we were surprised by the heat, as the temperature
soared to 29 degrees in the afternoons. It's not exactly pleasant for
trekking, so be prepared to get tired within 10-15 km walks - depending
on fitness level. We also noticed that Munnar can get quite crowded
during holidays and festivals; This being a long weekend with May 1st,
it was choke-a-block with cars, buses and maxis pouring in from all
directions. We hardly could manage a place to stay and could not find
any bikes to rent. So, I'd recommend visiting during off-peak seasons
like July-August, February-March, or November-December (excluding
festivals).

#### Stay

To enjoy a quieter time and do some bird spotting, it's better to stay
outside Munnar, preferably along the Coimbatore direction. It is a
paradise for birdwatching, and we were delighted to hear the beautiful
birdcalls throughout our stay.

#### Explore

The best way to explore the area was by renting a bike or car. But since
we could not get one, we went for the alternate: hiring an auto for the
day for a package tour. Not ideal and not our rhythm, but well. You can
hire an auto or jeep for the day package (either Coimbatore / Matupetty
/ Thekkady or Cochin direction) for around INR 1200-2000, depending upon
the season and the route.

My Vijay - our homestay owner - was a very helpful guy. He connected us
with Mr. Mani, the manager of Maharaja Travels, who in turn connected us
with two friendly and reliable guides/auto drivers - Victor Mani and
Bhaskar - who took us around for day trips.

#### Highlights

One of the highlights of our trip was the guided hike to Thoovanam falls
in Chinnar sanctuary. Although it was a group hike, the guides were
quite relaxed about letting us explore on our own. We even encountered
some interesting "dragonfly piss" (as our guide jokingly called it)
along the way, which was likely from cicadas. We felt it coming down on
us each time we passed one of those trees buzzing with cicadas. I dare
say, I even saw the droplets raining down once!

Another beautiful spot We visited was Eravikulam National Park. However,
the actual hike was limited due to construction work, so We couldn't
walk with the Tahrs as We had hoped. If you have the chance, I'd
recommend looking into the special hiking packages that let you explore
the park more extensively.

*Some tips*:

> - There are separate queues for safari based on whether you booked the ticket from the counter or online. And the online-queue is significantly shorter.
> - So, try booking the ticket online, even if queuing up at the ticket counter.
> - Also, despite advertised closing time of 4 PM, we saw visitors filing in to the queue for safari as late as 4:30 PM and the return safari buses from top were available till 6 PM. Your mileage may vary.

#### Food

If you are staying in main Munnnar town, for food, I suggest heading
over to the main market after the HP petrol pump, where you can find
better options like Guru Bhavan. Service at Sarvana Bhavan was quite
slow and they also open up late - only after 8 AM. Keep in mind that
most places don't serve meals or thalis during dinner.

*Our weekend trip to Munnar was a refreshing change of pace. If you're
planning a visit, keep these tips in mind, and you'll have a fantastic
time exploring this beautiful destination!*
