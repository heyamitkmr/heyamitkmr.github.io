## Hi, I'm Amit!

## About me
<em>Last updated: 2024-10-25</em>

#### Short Answer:

I am still really into sci-fi movies and have watched all of the good ones available (80s onwards). My interest in AI and Machine Learning has grown considerably, and I'm particularly fascinated by applications of LLMs for solving real-world problems. Creating, tinkering with things are important to my wellbeing. I feel a bit unhinged if I have not been able to for a while. These days, I'm working on building [NextFive](https://www.nextfive.in/).

I am also passionate about photography and capturing the beauty in everyday moments. You can find some of my work at [my Flickr collection](https://www.flickr.com/people/proxygeek/).

I also enjoy discussing privacy, smartphones, free software, and the importance of narratives. And some other random stuff I keep posting about sporadically on [my Hey blog](https://world.hey.com/akumar)

#### More formal answer:

*   Principal Product Manager at ServiceNow, where I've been for the past four years, helping customers measure, monitor, and improve their outcomes using analytics and guided maps.
*   Over 14 years in the tech industry, with roles in software engineering, product management, and entrepreneurship. Experience spans various domains, from finance and border security to human capital management (HCM).
*   Advocate for [learning-by-doing](https://world.hey.com/akumar/the-cold-start-problem-471b49a4) and believe in creating opportunities for people to develop skills by working on real-world problems.
*   Passionate about using technology to make a positive impact and am actively involved in community-building initiatives, such as People+AI, where we are documenting and cataloging [AI use-cases relevant to India](https://coda.io/d/Use-Case-Garden-v0-1_doqFblpa9DQ/The-Use-Case-Garden-v0-1_suQyq0cN#_lut1G21-).
*   **Keywords**: Product Management, AI, LLM, Workflows, Analytics, Mentorship, Cross-functional team management, Team leadership, Rapid prototyping, User-centered design, Community management, Stakeholder management, Python, Machine Learning, SQL, Shell

### What are you doing these days? Anything cool?

Still working on cool stuff with NLP and LLMs. Some of my recent projects include:

*   Building the analytics platform at ServiceNow
*   Volunteering with PeoplePlus.ai to help develop the AI ecosystem in India
*   Learning how to learn, with help from some friends at NextFive.in
*   Eexperimenting in fostering storytelling and democratizing photography as art; Building a space that embraces all creators and appreciators without the gatekeepers at [picturethis.in](https://www.picturethis.in/)
*   Tinkering with LLMs and scripts for automating tasks like blog publishing, backups, and transcription using scripts, summarizing Hacker News threads and more


### What about some of your previous work - anything I would know or might have seen / used?

My work has touched various industries and aspects of technology. You might have unknowingly encountered some of my previous contributions:

*   Early in my career, I worked on systems for detecting financial anomalies at major Investment Banks. Hopefully, you haven't crossed paths with this work.
*   I contributed to border security systems related to visa processing and passenger manifests. If you've traveled to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, or Australia, you might have interacted with some of my behind-the-scenes work.
*   I was involved in developing a modern reporting system for Human Capital Management. There's a 17% chance your HR department might be using it if you work for a US-based company.
*   I worked on custom NLP solutions for tasks like data de-duplication and survey response categorization. It's possible your data was processed by one of these systems.
*   If you ever raised a customer complaint or internal request of some sort at your organization, there's a likelihood you used some of my work on ServiceNow platform analytics. Or the process owners handling your requests did.

### What excites you about your work?

I am driven by solving interesting problems that have a tangible positive impact on people's lives.  I am particularly excited about the potential of AI and technology to make things simpler, more efficient, and accessible for everyone.

## About NextFive
<b>Q: <i>"This is clearly about you, Amit. So, what's with the nextfive.xyz'</i></b>
<br/>
<p>
Me: Clearly, you are not named "Amit". Or you are one of unlimited means. <br/>Do you have <em> any </em> idea how difficult it is to lay claim on anything resembling "Amit" from Gmail to Discord to Bluesky and Intersteller Web - whenever that comes out?
<br/><br/>
NextFive has it origins with that specific trouble. Also, it seemed like there are always 5 new things I'm interested in ...and it sounded fun.
<br/><br/>
<a href="https://www.nextfive.xyz/">NextFive.xyz</a> was originally available for a lower price than other TLDs with reasonable recall. So, I used this as somewhere to Blog and post stuff. Every couple of year or so. Then I got into exploring the idea of something more public and marginally more professional a front. I called it NextFiveInc. But that "xyz" TLD sounded shady for something like this. So, <a href="https://www.nextfive.in/chapters">NextFive.in</a> serves as the home for this endeavour.
