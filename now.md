## Well, so how have I been?

I'm deliberately moving from a 10-year corporate PM career toward creative independence - through writing, building products, and creating community. The focus is on freedom: control over my time, being useful to others, and building things that exist independent of me.

### The big three:

1. **Writing the book (deadline: June 2026)**
  - Practicing more regular writing; Learning Substack with "[EarlyNotes](https://earlynotes.substack.com/)" -  sharing thoughts on what I have seen working for me; Continuing to use [my Hey blog](https://world.hey.com/akumar) and [nextfive.xyz](http://new.nextfive.xyz/) for my other personal writings.
  - Planning to self-publish via KDP / Pothi by June 2026 (ideally after getting a validation of a possible audience)
  - It's become less about vanity and more about sharing ideas that genuinely helped me

2. **[Guide app](https://blog.nextfive.in/guide/): a personal productivity system I built**
  - Just launched v29 with onboarding improvements
  - Testing if people find value in it

3. **Learning to earn without a salary** (my version of financial independence)
  - Experimenting with different income streams
  - Recently focused on identifying 5 concrete projects to commit 2 hours daily to, starting January 2026
  - Less exploring, more shipping and selling

**Why these three?**
Because I realized I have enough ideas. What I need now is to move from planning to doing, from building to shipping. Dialing down the exploration a notch and [starting to focus on exploitation](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/multi-armed-bandit).

### Also happening:
- Getting more and more comfortable driving:  still working on this skill, especially on driving on hill roads and going for outstation trips
- Building community through the Public Living Room concept: connecting interesting people around ideas and projects
- Getting comfortable with public storytelling - considering TEDx talks and other speaking opportunities.
- [Smaller passion projects](https://www.nextfive.in/chapters) like [PictureThis](https://www.picturethis.in/) or[Toolish](https://blog.nextfive.in/products/); [ThePhotos.org](https://thephotos.org/) is getting less attention for now.
